a serge-inspired sequencer toolbox for norns/seamstress.

## quick start

navigate to the params menu and go to the `outputs` section. enter one of the output submenu (e.g. `Output #1`) and set the `nb Voice` param to a midi device or nb voice (such as [emplaitress](https://llllllll.co/t/n-b-et-al-v0-1/60374) or [oilcan](https://llllllll.co/t/oilcan-percussion-co/60754)). yo√ßu should now hear sound.

you can then assign more outputs to more voices, generate a new random patch (`K1 + K3` on norns, `R` on seamstress), play around with various params and navigate to the different screens to interract with the whole patch (grid required for most operations).

the heart of it is a reproduction of the hale [8 Stage Complex Sequencing Programmer](https://www.modulargrid.net/s/hale-8-stage-complex-sequencing-programmer), itself based on the classic Serge Sequencer / Programmer.
